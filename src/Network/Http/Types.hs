    The bit that builds up the actual string to be transmitted. This
    is on the critical path for every request, so we'll want to revisit
    this to improve performance.

    - Rewrite rule for Method?
    - How can serializing the Headers be made efficient?

    This code includes the RFC compliant CR-LF sequences as line
    terminators, which is why the Show instance above has to bother
    with removing them.

    This is a fair bit of trouble just to avoid using a typedef here.
    Probably worth it, though; every other HTTP client library out there
    exposes the gory details of the underlying map implementation, and

    this code used here in the Show instance for debugging has been
    copied & pasted around various projects of mine since I started
    writing Haskell. It's quite tedious, and very arcane! So, wrap it
    up.
